Implement pluribus. Commit frequently. Use pytest for unit tests, and include e2e tests with actual repos. Aim to make this easy and fun to use. Improvements should focus on streamlining, simplicity, and making things intuitive and fun. Keep a CHANGELOG and a record of problems, ambiguities, concerns, and decisions you encounter and make.
